            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Laſt Letters from <hi>Germany,</hi> of the 20, 21ſt, and 22d. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, give Account that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was Encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, about Twenty <hi>Leagues</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> with the Army of <hi>German,</hi> as well as <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe, under his Command; and that in the Perſuit of the <hi>Turks-</hi> Since the Twelveth, before <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> they had cut many <hi>Scatter'd Parties</hi> into Pieces, and have taken near forty heavy <hi>Cannon:</hi> with a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Aminition</hi> that Attended them, and had alſo, a Fierce Battle, with a Grand Body of the Turkiſh Horſe; who where under the Conduct of the <hi>Grand
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151828:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vizier</hi> in Perſon, &amp; had killed near twenty thouſand of them upon the place. And it is credibly Affirm'd the <hi>Grand-Vizier,</hi> is taken <hi>Priſoner</hi> the Principle Standard of the <hi>Ottaman Empire</hi> is alſo taken; not without loſs on the Chriſtian ſide: For the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſaid to Engage in this Battle with a fury, rather proceeding from an Apprehenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deſpair, than true Courage, or good Conduct; and continued the Battle ſeveral Hours with great obſtinacy, notwithſtanding the great Slaughters the Chriſtians made in all parts of the Battle. This Battle being ended, and the Chriſtians by the miraculous Providence of God, crowned with a ſecond Victory, continued their perſuit with great eagerneſs, and fell upon another party of Turkiſh Horſe, (who had the Conduct of near Ten thouſand Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Captives) and Totally Routed them, and redeemed the poor Chriſtians from the perpetual Chains of <hi>Bondage</hi> that then had ſeized them. Moſt of the ſaid poor Chriſtians, were young choice Men, that the Turks had Catcht up, ever ſince they made this laſt Invaſion, into the Chriſtian Emerours Country's. (In their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging, they cut off all Middle-Aged, and Elderly people without reſpect of perſons or Sexes.) This dileverance of the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, being no way leſs Conſiderable than the former; and for which all good Chriſtians in Duty, ought to Return hearty thanks, to the Divine diſpoſer of all things. The undanted and unwearied King of <hi>Poland,</hi> after this Defeat, had not purſued the Enemy above three, or four Leagues, but recieved Advice by <hi>Scouts,</hi> that a Great Army of Turkiſh Horſe, was on its March with Great Expedition; which cauſed his Majeſty to make an Hault, &amp; ſend expreſs to the Duke of <hi>Lorain;</hi> to haſten to him with the <hi>German</hi> Foot, and accordingly the <hi>Auxiliries</hi> of the Empire (who have been conſiderably Reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſince the Beating the Turks from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi>) are on their March withal Expedition, to joyn the <hi>Poliſh Camp.</hi> And it's the Opinion of all, that the Turks will run the hazard of another Battle. It is alſo affirm'd, that beſides the <hi>Grand-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>izier,</hi> ſeveral other Perſons of great Note, in the Turkiſh State are taken Priſoners; and that this freſh Army has been gathered with great Diligence, and deſigned to joyn the <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> which Extraordinary preparation is judged, could not proceed otherwiſe, than from great Aſſurances that have been privately made, as well as the open Aſſiſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved from the Tekillitiſh Rebels, the firſt of which kind of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. It's believed, the <hi>
